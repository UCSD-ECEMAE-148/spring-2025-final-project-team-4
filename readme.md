Abstract
______________

We decided to work on adding a robotic arm pioleted by servo motors to our car. With the objective of having the car drive to an object and pick it up. Additional objectives were discused such as bringing the object to another location or finding multiple objects but those objectives were not realised. This project incorporated an arduino micro controler to act as the servo driver which our jetson comunicated with through serial comunication
